# Obsidian Graph MCP - Exclusion Patterns
# ========================================
#
# This file controls which folders/files are excluded from indexing.
# Copy to your vault as: .obsidian-graph.conf
#
# How it works:
# - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Each line is a pattern to exclude
# - Patterns are matched against paths relative to vault root
#
# Pattern types:
# - Folder path:  07_Archive/Trash/     (excludes folder and all contents)
# - Glob pattern: drafts/*              (excludes all files in drafts/)
# - File pattern: *.tmp.md              (excludes all .tmp.md files)
#
# === DEFAULTS (always excluded, no need to add) ===
